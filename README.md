## Introduction

This repository showcases a practice portfolio website built with a focus on modern development practices. It utilizes the following technologies:

* **Next.js :** A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation, providing a smooth user experience and SEO benefits.
* **Tailwind CSS :** A utility-first CSS framework offering rapid and responsive design customization.
* **Aceternity UI :** A collection of pre-built React components for a sleek and efficient UI foundation.
* **Sentry :** An error monitoring platform to capture and analyze any potential issues for a more robust user experience.

This portfolio serves as a demonstration of my skills in building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.  Feel free to explore the code and see how these technologies are implemented!
